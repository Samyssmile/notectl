**notectl** is a rich text editor shipped as a native Web Component (`<notectl-editor>`). It is designed from the ground up with a strict layered architecture, immutable data structures, a powerful plugin system, and comprehensive accessibility support.

## Key Features

- **Web Component** — Works in any framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) or plain HTML
- **Plugin-based** — Every feature is a plugin. Use only what you need.
- **Immutable State** — All state changes are expressed as invertible transactions with step-based history
- **Declarative Toolbar** — Configure toolbar layout with a simple array-of-arrays syntax
- **Custom Fonts** — Load WOFF2/TTF/OTF fonts with automatic `@font-face` injection
- **Tables** — Full table support with cell selection, row/column operations
- **Accessible** — ARIA roles, screen reader announcements, keyboard navigation throughout
- **Type-safe** — Written in strict TypeScript with branded types and exhaustive type guards

## How It Works

notectl follows a unidirectional data flow:

```
User Input → Transaction (Steps) → Middleware → New State → DOM Reconciliation
```

Every change creates a `Transaction` containing one or more `Steps`. Steps are atomic, invertible operations (insert text, add mark, split block, etc.). The transaction passes through a middleware chain, then produces a new immutable `EditorState`. The view layer diffs the old and new state and patches the DOM at block granularity.

This architecture gives you:

- **Predictable updates** — state is always consistent
- **Built-in undo/redo** — every step can be inverted
- **Plugin interception** — middleware can modify or cancel transactions
- **Easy testing** — state transitions are pure functions

## Architecture at a Glance

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Model** | Immutable data types: `Document`, `BlockNode`, `TextNode`, `Mark`, `Selection` |
| **State** | `EditorState` container, `Transaction` builder, `History` manager |
| **View** | DOM reconciliation, selection sync, input handling |
| **Commands** | High-level operations: `toggleMark`, `splitBlock`, `deleteBackward` |
| **Plugins** | Feature modules that register schema, commands, keymaps, toolbar items |
